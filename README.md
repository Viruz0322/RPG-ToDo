# <Ameliorate>

## Description

Ameliorate can stimulate your day and plan it out so you don’t have to.  Our team shared a growing passion in RPG’s and video games. However we realized that the world we live in doesn’t offer that same structure and motivating factors that video games do. We knew that if we could spice up the lives of our users and utilize rewards to keep them on track, we would then be able to inspire them to accomplish and power through their tasks.  Our nifty game-like to-do planner helps the user gain the diligence to complete mundane chores with the end benefit of small rewards.
