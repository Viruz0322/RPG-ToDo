# <Ameliorate>

## Description

Ameliorate can stimulate your day and plan it out so you don’t have to.  Our team shared a growing passion in RPG’s and video games. However we realized that the world we live in doesn’t offer that same structure and motivating factors that video games do. We knew that if we could spice up the lives of our users and utilize rewards to keep them on track, we would then be able to inspire them to accomplish and power through their tasks.  Our nifty game-like to-do planner helps the user gain the diligence to complete mundane chores with the end benefit of small rewards.

## Usage

A user will arrive at the site and be prompted to create a profile. After loging in, the user will be able to add tasks to their TO-Do list. In order to add a task the user will have to select a class, the classes are categories that the pregenerated tasks have been sorted into. then using the drop down menu a user can select the task they want. They will then be asked what difficulty level they want for that task. then the task is added. After that point, a user will go throughout their day and when they complete a task they will log in and check off that they completed the task and be rewarded with the points associated with that task and difficulty.
